## 🟦 B-Tier (Good)

8. Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015)  
   A messy, sci-fi-heavy narrative that’s ambitious but convoluted — better with co-op.

9. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014)  
   Strong start with great tech and Kevin Spacey’s performance — ends weaker.

10. Call of Duty 2 (2005)  
   Classic WWII action — great for its time, though less cinematic by today’s standards.

11. Call of Duty: Vanguard (2021)  
   Cool multi-perspective concept, but the execution lacks depth and cohesion.

## 🟥 C-Tier (Disappointing)

12. Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012)  
   Innovative branching choices, but the narrative suffers from uneven pacing.

13. Call of Duty: Ghosts (2013)  
   Decent action and visuals, but a forgettable story with weak character development.

14. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011)  
   Concludes the trilogy but feels rushed — more bombastic than impactful.
